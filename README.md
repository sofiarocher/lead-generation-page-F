# Lead Generation Landing Page

This lead generation landing page is designed to capture the interest of potential clients and encourage them to schedule a call with our team. Currently, the website is inactive due to pending content from the client. Once active, it will serve as a primary platform to engage users and generate leads through multiple calls to action (CTAs).

## Current Status 

The landing page is currently inactive as we await the final content from the client. The structure, design, and core functionalities are in place, ready to be populated with the client's content to fully activate the lead generation process.
## Features

- Multiple Calls to Action: Strategically placed CTAs throughout the page to maximize user engagement and conversion rates.
- i18n Translation: The site supports internationalization, offering content in multiple languages to cater to a global audience.
- Swiper.js Gallery: An interactive and responsive gallery to showcase services, products, or client testimonials.

## Tech Stack

- React: For building the responsive and interactive landing page.
- Vite: Utilized as the build tool and development server for a fast and efficient development experience.
- i18n: For implementing multi-language support, ensuring accessibility to a diverse audience.
